** DONE CM 1/16/19 ** - Need to test out the target found in an incoming RR File drop to make sure it is set correctly. 

- Test reseting a received REST API file

- When selecting a target and HEL Registry Website as transport no need to select the configuration, it should come from the selected source.

** DONE CM 3/7/19 ** - transactionindetailauditerrors_batchId is not being loaded when errors are found, seems like SP populateAuditReport is not being called.

- Need to add "Direct Messaging" for a transport type
    - When "Direct Messaging" is selected show the following.
	- Need to show a drop down of available hisps
	- Need to ask for the direct message domain
	- Need to ask for the expected attachment extension

	When SAVE
	- Need to create a folder if doesn't exist alread in HELProductSuite/universalTranslator/directMessages/ORG NAME NO SPACES
	- Store these values in a table so when the same org selects "Direct Messaging" for another configuration it pre-populates
	- Single org will only have a single HISP when sending via direct so one or shouldn't have multiple settings

- "Direct Messaging" API
    - Should look at the new DM table to match domain created above
    - Take that domain in order to validate the received file to a organization in order to drop the file to the HELProductSuite/universalTranslator/directMessages/ORG NAME NO SPACES folder
    - Modify if needed the rest API section to account for Direct Messages
    - Need to make sure all checks are in place in order to create the entry in the rest API entry
    - Payload stored should contain the Number of attachments, sending direct message address and any other information we can capture
    - Need to save the sending direct message somewhere in the batch upload in order to be able to send it back

- Need to review/modify the REST API processing job in order to watch the directMessage folder for files and move them just like we do sFTP files.

- Need to add a place in the system admin to add HISPS (Med Allies would be the first). Need ability to add API credentials to this section
